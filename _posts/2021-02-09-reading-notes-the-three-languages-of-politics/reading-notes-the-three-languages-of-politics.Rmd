### Book Info
["The Three Languages of Politics: Talking Accross the Political Divides"](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Languages-Politics-Talking-Political/dp/1948647427/)

by Arnold Kling (3^rd^ Edition)  


### Thesis  

Political languages evolved in context of tribal gamesmanship. The languages enable political communication in a manner that effectively signals to our own political tribes; not being understood by other tribes is a feature and not a bug.  

A three-axis model is posited that describes the predominate paradigm that frames each tribeâ€™s political communications.  

1. Progressive Axis: Oppressor <---> Oppressed  
2. Conservative Axis: Civilization <---> Barbarism  
3. Libertarian Axis: Liberty <---> Coercion  

### Quick Guide to the Groups 

Group         | Believe in        | Revere     | View markets as  
--------------|-------------------|------------|---------------------
Progressives  | Human betterment  | Science    | Unfair  
Conservatives | Human weakness    | The past   | Virtuous  
Libertarians  | Human rationality | Technology | Peaceful cooperation  

### Why It Matters  

Family, enduring friendship, meaningful shared work, and local communities are declining. Political tribalism is expanding to fill the resulting void.  

Motivated reasoning occurs instinctively and at an unconscious level. Open-minded reasoning requires effort and an ability to understand other political languages; such fluency allows disagreement without conflict.  

### On Reasonable Disagreement  
Good-faith disagreements can occur between coherent, reasonable points of view. Rather than questioning the reasonability of an opposing view, a better question may be whether its application is appropriate for the circumstances.  

Heuristic:  

> "The only person you are qualified to pronounce unreasonable is yourself."
