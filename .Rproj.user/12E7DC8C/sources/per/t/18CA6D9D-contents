### Thesis

Assessment for Learning has failed to deliver significant improvements in UK schools because it has inadvertently become Assessment of Learning.  

1. Partially due to government involvement in accountability efforts
2. Significantly due to “generic skill” pedagogy that predominates school systems  

Assessment of Learning is built on harnessing feedback from (formative) assessment to increase progress: implementation has been plagued by “accurate but not useful” feedback.  

### Generic Skill Method vs Deliberate Practice Method

_Generic Skill Method_: complex skills, such as problem solving, communication, or critical thinking, are discrete and can be taught directly  

_Deliberate Practice Method_: complex skills---including learning itself---are dependent on large bodies of detailed, domain-specific content knowledge  

Implications for assessment  

* From the Generic Skill perspective, similar tasked are used for summative and formative assessments.  
* From the Deliberate Practice perspective, formative tasks are intentionally much narrower and more specific than summative assessment tasks.  

> “The aim of performance is to use mental models. The aim of learning is to create them.”

### Summative vs Formative Assessment

_Summative Assessment_ --  

* Judge the extent of learning for purpose of grading or certification
* Create a shared meaning that goes beyond the context in which it is made

    1. Standard conditions (including external help)
    2. Discriminating items
    3. Representative enough sample
    4. Scaled scores (if practical)

_Formative Assessment_ --  

* Provide useful consequences to inform what should be done next

    1. Specific
    2. Frequent
    3. Repetitive
    4. Record as raw marks

### Validity vs Reliability

_Validity_ -- process of evaluating the inferences drawn from the results of an assessment  

_Reliability_ -- amount of inconsistency between one measurement and the next  

Making assessment tasks more authentic can reduce reliability.  However, validity is about the inferences from test results---not the test itself. Therefore, reliability is a prerequisite for validity.  

### Miscellaneous Ideas

* _Willingham's What to Remember_ --  

    1. Knowledge and skills used over and over
    2. Knowledge needed to enable long-term of key concepts
    3. Knowledge important enough to remember later in life  

* _Goodhart’s Law_ -- When a measure becomes a target, it loses value as a measure.  

* _Kuhn’s Exemplars_ -- For many concepts, their meaning is better defined by a community’s accepted set of examples---concrete problems with solutions---than through prose definition.
